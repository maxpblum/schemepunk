ASCII Tetris in Scheme!

Just load the code file and run (play-game). To move or quit, type j, k, l,  i, d, or q, and hit enter. That's all there is!

Try it online [here](http://repl.it/3sb/35) (hit the play button near the top-middle of the screen, then follow the instructions above).

This was my last-morning-at-Hacker-School project.

Hacker Schoolers:
I will miss you all!
